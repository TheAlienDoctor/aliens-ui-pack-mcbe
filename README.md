## Feature list

- Fully removed background from pause screen and inventory screens
- Removed marketplace button in pause screen
- Added a pointless Alien button on pause screen and play screen
- Removed vignette (Credit: BedrockTweaks.net)
- Removed background from chat and position (Same as my clearchat pack)
- Removed the background of the paper doll in inventoyr, as sometimes it would mess up skins (including the shoes of mine)
- Added toggleable co-ordinates (Same as my standalone toggle co-ords pack). This means paper doll will not work with this pack. You can toggle co-ords using f8
- Removed how to play button from inventory (Inspired from BedrockTweaks.net, but uses different methods)
- Removed background of sidebar scoreboards
- No nether particles
- Smaller rain
- Removed background of item name (the one that appears when you select it on your hotbar)
- Added some fun splash screen and loading messages related to me :D
- Honestly there might be something I missed, I didn't keep a list of features when I made this :facepalm:
